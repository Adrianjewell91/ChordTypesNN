This is the Neural Network Backpropagation exercise from Andrew Ng's Machine learning course, modified to train a 88 -> 12 -> 48 dense neural network to classify triads by type (maj, min, aug, diminished) and pitch. 

To run:

1. Install Octave 
2. Go to the /lib directory 
3. Run octave, and run ex4 and it will run.
